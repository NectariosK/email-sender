Oh, hello there,

Coding is fun, isn't it?
Being inspired by my Python Developer online course tutor, coding has become very dear and dear to my heart. Very enthusiastic about learning more but first, this project/repository has two files attached to enable one to send emails with python together with html.

Cheers!
