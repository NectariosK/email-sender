Oh, hello there,

Coding is fun, isn't it?
Being inspired by my Python Developer online course tutor, coding has become very dear and near to my heart. I'm very enthusiastic about learning more but first, let me highlight a few things about this project/repository; it has two files attached to enable one to send emails with python together with html.

Cheers!
